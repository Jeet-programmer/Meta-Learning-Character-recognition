# MEta-Learning-Character-Recognition

A PyTorch-based project that applies **Meta-Learning** techniques to the problem of **few-shot handwritten character recognition**. This project uses Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to enable the model to quickly adapt to new character classes with limited examples.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository demonstrates the power of meta-learning in recognizing handwritten characters with few labeled samples. It is especially useful in scenarios where collecting a large dataset is impractical. The project includes:

* A MAML-based training script.
* Pre-trained model weights.
* A lightweight prediction app.
* Sample datasets for experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/MEta-Learning-Character-Recognition.git](https://github.com/Jeet-programmer/Meta-Learning-Character-recognition.git)
cd MEta-Learning-Character-Recognition
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model

To train the MAML model from scratch:

```bash
python train.py
```

Ensure your datasets are correctly placed in the `Datasets/` directory.

---

## 🔍 Running Inference

To run predictions using the pre-trained model:

```bash
python predict_app.py
```

> You can modify the `predict_app.py` to take input images and display predicted character classes.

---

## 📁 Datasets

* Place your character datasets inside the `Datasets/` folder.
* The folder `all_data/` might be used for additional metadata or consolidated dataset formats.

---

## 🧪 Requirements

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Key packages include:

* `torch`
* `numpy`
* `Pillow`
* `streamlit` (if using a UI-based prediction app)

---

## 📌 Notes

* This project is intended for research and educational use.
* Adapt the dataset preprocessing and model architecture as needed for your specific use case or language.
